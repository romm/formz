You can find at this address a full example extension, which uses a majority of the functionality provided by Formz.

To install it:

* Clone the repository with Git (``git clone https://github.com/romm/formz.git``);
* Or download the archive and add it to the ``typo3conf/ext/`` folder of your TYPO3 instance.

You can find further information by reading the file `README.md <https://github.com/romm/formz_example/blob/master/README.md>`_.
