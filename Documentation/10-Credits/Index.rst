Direct Energie
--------------

The development of FormZ has been sponsored by `Direct Energie <http://www.direct-energie.com/>`_: first alternative energy provider with more than 1.8 million customers in France and Belgium.

This company proposes several offers of electricity and gas supply for individuals and professionals. Its websites are developed in order to offer the best customer experience in this domain, by regrouping the forms usage with the development of a specific tool for these needs. Direct Energie has been trusting TYPO3 for years to set up its digital presence and did not hesitate to requite the work of this open-source community by releasing the FormZ extension.

I want to thank the whole team which provided a lot of support during the development of this tool, but also for the awesome atmosphere which transforms work into a daily pleasure! :-)
